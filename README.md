# Polished Example Applications <img src="images/polished_logo_transparent.png" align="right" width="120" />

Example applications for using [polished](https://github.com/Tychobra/polished) for authentication and user management.

Live Demo Shiny apps using polished

- [Shiny Apps Dashboard](https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/apps_dashboard).  With `polished`, users can sign in to multiple Shiny apps using the same email/password sign in credentials.  This allows you to make a dashboard of our Shiny apps.  Users who sign into the "Shiny Apps Dashboard" (or any Shiny app hosted in the same polished project) will then not have to reenter their credentials to switch between the Shiny apps they are authorized to access.  You can set user access at a per Shiny application level.  These are the example Shiny apps we included in the Dashboard
  - [Insurance Claims Dashboard](https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/basic-insurer-dashboard)
  - [Interest Rate Walk](https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/interest-rate-walk)
