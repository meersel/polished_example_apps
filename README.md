Example Shiny applications using [polished](https://github.com/Tychobra/polished) for authentication and user management.

Live Demo Shiny apps using polished

- Basic minimal example - coming soon

- [custom_sign_in](https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/custom_sign_in) Example with custom sign in page.

- [apps_dashboard](https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/apps_dashboard). With `polished`, users can sign in to multiple Shiny apps using the same email/password sign in credentials.  This allows you to make a dashboard of Shiny apps.  Users who sign into the dashboard of Shiny apps (or any Shiny app hosted in the same polished project) will then not have to reenter their credentials to switch between the Shiny apps they are authorized to access.  You can set user access at a per Shiny application level.  These are the example Shiny apps we included in the Shiny Apps Dashboard

  - [interest_rate_walk](https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/interest_rate_walk)

- [no_invite_required](https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/no_) Example that Does not require and invite.
